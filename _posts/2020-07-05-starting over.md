It's time to change my approach to learning programming.

## What I plan to do

Cut out the passive learning part.

### No tutorial projects and freeCodeCamp

I'm pretty good at two things: following tutorials and taking test. When doing freeCodeCamp challenges or building a tutorial project, I found myself in a "autopilot learning mode". My focus becomes passing the tests or finish the videos. There's no thinking involved and no problem to solve. Nothing retained. This time I will try to learn a tool by reading its documentation instead.

### Daily brain dump

The best way to avoid falling into autopilot learning mode will probably be writing a log everyday. I will try to be clear on what I know and what I don't know. The point is to find the margin to improve and be slightly better everyday.

## What I've done

Below are a few things I've done in the past 23 months:

### I built this site

Fancy hamburger menu in version 1.

Version 2 is cleaner than version 1.

Hamburger menu in version 2.

Version 3 has syntax highlighting and colour orange.

I separated notes with posts in version 4. Remove JavaScript and rewrite my CSS with BEM methodology.

Then I made it into a portfolio.

### Meet people

I went to a local [UX/UI design workshop](https://github.com/ladieslearningcode/llc-ux) and a few meetups. I started a [100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge and found [CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/chat) community on Twitter.

### Open source?

I joined my very first [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and completed it with ~~cheating~~ baby contributions. It is not open source at all. More like learning how to PR?

- Share favorite learning resources in [bhavaniravi/my-favorite-resources](https://github.com/bhavaniravi/my-favorite-resources).
- Become a contributor for [womenintech-chennai/womenintech-website](https://github.com/womenintech-chennai/womenintech-website).
- A pixel and translation for the [twilio-labs/open-pixel-art](https://github.com/twilio-labs/open-pixel-art).

### Work with others

I found a program where you can team up with other learners to build a project.

I got accepted into Chingu Voyage 13.

We built a Momentum clone named [MoTo](https://medium.com/@mingyong/introducing-moto-from-chingu-voyage-13-c1c1f9e98f80) in 6 week-long Agile sprints.

Not to forget some wonky projects and notes. You can find the notes under category 2019.
