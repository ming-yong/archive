It's time to change my approach to learning programming.

## Problems in my current approach

I am very good at taking tests and following tutorials. The downside of this is I tend to fall into an "autopilot learning" mode. My focus becomes completing the challenges and finish all the videos. I am making progress statistically, but there is no thinking involved and problem to solve in the process. 

Secondly, I found myself branching off the curriculum a lot. Should I follow my current interest and learn what I want? Or should I follow the learning path because it is well-designed?

### What I plan to do

Here are a few things I am planning to do this time:

1. No tutorials. No freeCodeCamp. If I want to learn how a tool works, I will read the documentation and build a toy project.
2. I will write about what I learn daily(brain dump). I don't like the word "blog" that much, mainly because I feel like I am writing for someone. I am not trying to write an article but more of a public learning journal. The ideas of "daily brain dump" are creating a habit of showing up to learning everyday, practice talking about ideas(which I am super bad at), and avoid falling into "autopilot learning" mode.
3. When I feel like I have enough knowledge on a topic, I will publish a post on Dev.to and talk about it with other developers.

## What I've done

Below are a few things I've done in the past 23 months:

### I built this site

Fancy hamburger menu in version 1.

Version 2 is cleaner than version 1.

Hamburger menu in version 2.

Version 3 has syntax highlighting and colour orange.

I separated notes with posts in version 4. Remove JavaScript and rewrite my CSS with BEM methodology.

Then I made it into a portfolio.

### Meet people

I went to a local [UX/UI design workshop](https://github.com/ladieslearningcode/llc-ux) and a few meetups. I started a [100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge and found [CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/chat) community on Twitter.

### Open source?

I joined my very first [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and completed it with ~~cheating~~ baby contributions. It is not open source at all. More like learning how to PR?

- Share favorite learning resources in [bhavaniravi/my-favorite-resources](https://github.com/bhavaniravi/my-favorite-resources).
- Become a contributor for [womenintech-chennai/womenintech-website](https://github.com/womenintech-chennai/womenintech-website).
- A pixel and translation for the [twilio-labs/open-pixel-art](https://github.com/twilio-labs/open-pixel-art).

### Work with others

I found a program where you can team up with other learners to build a project.

I got accepted into Chingu Voyage 13.

![Chingu certification]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2019/chingu/chinguCert.PNG)

We built a Momentum clone named [MoTo](https://medium.com/@mingyong/introducing-moto-from-chingu-voyage-13-c1c1f9e98f80) in 6 week-long Agile sprints.

Not to forget some wonky projects and notes. You can find the notes under category 2019.
