Designing Data-Intensive Applications. Chapter 2.

## Declarative and Imperative

SQL is declarative. It hides how the query works, which means we don't have to worry about changing the query in data optimization. It supports parallel execution and is easier to work with compare to the imperative query. The book also uses CSS and JS to explain these two terms.

A graph-like model consists of vertices(nodes/entities) and edges(relationship/arcs). It introduces the property graph and its declarative query language cypher.
