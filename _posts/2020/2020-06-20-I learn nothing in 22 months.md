It has been ~22 months since I started learning computer programming. To be honest, I feel like I have ~~wasted~~ spent so much time to make tiny tiny little bit of progress. Anyway, here's a brief of what happened so far:

## I started and quit freeCodeCamp

I know it's a well-design learning path but I found myself learning just for the sake of it. I decided to quit (at least for now) after completing a few certifications.

## First project

My writing skill is just as terrible as my coding skill so this is never a blog. It's more a place for notes. To me the difference is I don't read my notes (so I guess nobody will) unless I need to whereas a blog post is a enjoyable read (supposedly).

This thing was uglier before and it evolved over time:

Fancy hamburger menu in version 1.

Version 2 is cleaner than version 1.

Version 3 has syntax highlighting and colour orange.

I separated notes with posts in version 4. Remove JavaScript and rewrite my CSS with BEM methodology.

Then I made it into a portfolio.

## Try to meet others

I went to a local [UX/UI design workshop](https://github.com/ladieslearningcode/llc-ux) and a few meetups. I started a [100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge and found [CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/chat) community on Twitter.

## Open source?

I joined my very first [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and completed it with ~~cheating~~ baby contributions. It is not open source at all. More like learning how to PR?

- Become a contributor for [womenintech-chennai/womenintech-website](https://github.com/womenintech-chennai/womenintech-website).
- A pixel and translation for the [twilio-labs/open-pixel-art](https://github.com/twilio-labs/open-pixel-art).

## Work with others

I found a program where you can team up with other learners to build a project.

I got accepted into Chingu Voyage 13.

We built a Momentum clone named [MoTo](https://medium.com/@mingyong/introducing-moto-from-chingu-voyage-13-c1c1f9e98f80) in 6 week-long Agile sprints.

And that's all I can recall from my memory.
