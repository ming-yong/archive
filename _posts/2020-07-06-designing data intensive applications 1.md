I started reading "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann today. I'm currently in Chapter one. It is about terminology in this book.

We use the term "data system" to refer to different data tools as most of them serve multi-purpose nowadays. One of the examples it mentioned is Apache Kafka: message queues with database-like durability guarantees. I've heard about it quite frequently.

It then defines the term "Reliability" as still working when encountering some faults(not fails).
