Designing Data-Intensive Applications. Chapter 2.

We can express the graph relationship in SQL, but it is clumsy. Triple-Store model is similar to the graph model. It consists of `(subject, predicate, object)`. Turtle triples(I think Turtle, a subset of Notation3, is a way to express the data?) The chapter then talks about the semantic web, RDF(Resource Description Framework), and a query language SPARQL. They are all related to Triple-stores.

Although the graph model involves a lot of nesting, it is still different from the network model. There is no restriction on how things should be nested just to named one.
